%p Welcome to the beta for PokéLog! This app is in very early development, please don't hesitate to #{link_to "open an issue on GitHub", "https://github.com/vinnydiehl/pokelog/issues"} if you encounter any problems or have any recommendations.

%p PokéLog is an EV training tool/logbook for hardcore Pokémon enthusaists. The first feature that I'm refining is a page where you can search for Pokémon as you defeat them, clicking the button to adjust your trainee's EVs, taking into account EV-boosting items and Pokérus if selected. Here is a demo:

    allow: "accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media;

%p Being able to train multiple Pokémon at a time is obviously important since every Pokémon on your team that gains experience gains EVs. Implementing this functionality is a top priority.
